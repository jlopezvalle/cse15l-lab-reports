5. **WARNING** the password you use is the password you change in the beginning of this tutorial. Also when you are trying to type in your password in the terminal **IT WILL NOT APPEAR**. This is for security purposes, if you type it incorrectly press enter for the password line to appear again. 

6. When you press enter/return on your keyboard your terminal should look like the image below. Now you have successfully completed remote connecting! Let's try some commands to have more practice

## Now let's try some commands

1. Now let's try running some commands! Below are some commands that you can try out
  * `cd`
  * `ls`
  * `pwd`
  * `mkdir`
  * `cp`
  * `cd ~`
  * `ls -lat`
  * `ls -a`
  * `ls <directory>` replace `<directory>` with `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc` make sure to also replace `abc` with a proper username
  * `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/`
  * `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`

2, Down below are a few descpriptions of some of the commands and what they do.
  * `ls -la` : lists all the files and directories in the current working directory or a directory that the user specifies.
  * `ls -l` : option uses a long listing format which adds information about the permissions, size, last modified, etc. associated with the file or directory.
