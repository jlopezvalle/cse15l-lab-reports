## Part 2 : Reflection and Thoughts

* WOW, this quarter went by SO FAST! I could not imagine being able to learn the many different techniques and skills a few years back when dieting to be a computer science major. One topic that we addressed and I found to be really cool during our labs is building our very own web server. Building a server is something I have seen in movies and never would have imagined to be doing on my own one day with my partner. My partner and I helped each other to understand what we were doing and then tried it on our own. I felt really cool and "techy", just like Peneople Garcia from Criminal Minds lol. I even went back home during the memorial holiday and showed my family what I could do and they were impressed. This will stick with me even though some may think it's simple. I really thought it was cool!!!
