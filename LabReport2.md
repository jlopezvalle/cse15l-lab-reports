# Lab Report 1

## Welcome to CSE15L

## Part 1



* `Which methods in your code are called?`


* `What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?`


* `How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.`


## Part 2

Choose one of the bugs from lab 3.

The bug chosen from lab 3 is the reverseInPlace method with the reversed() method. In order to fix the bug from the reverseInPlace() method you need to create a new temp values to switch the array elemnts until it reaches the middle elemnt in the array. While as for the reversed() method the code was changeing the old array and did not return the new one. To fix it you need to reassign the value and make sure the correct array is being returned rather than the incorrect one.

## Part 3

In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didn’t know before.

I didn't know any of the things we did in lab for week 2 or 3, it was my first time but even so, what i would like to discuss is doing the 
NumberServer in week 2. When doing looking over the code provided from the lab i tried really hard to understand how it worked and why it
works. After intputting the follwoing commands into the terminal such as: 

```
⤇ javac Server.java NumberServer.java 
⤇ java NumberServer 4000
Server Started! Visit http://localhost:4000
```

I then opened up a browser in my computer and otyped the following `http://localhost:4000`. Ultimattely, I leanred how to run a server 
which was really cool and super fun to do. It made me feel really smart :)
